A HTML5, CSS3 (bootswatch), and Vanilla JavaScript - Expense Tracker. Where you can add the name of your expense, the date and the amount, you also can delete.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

My learning was focused on the structure of the OOP - programming paradigm - to create a to-do list with features, which is the same as a Expense Tracker. I could understand the use of constructor and how to render() with using static methods.

## Optimizations

If I had time, I would use Local Storage to gather that data and make it time worth it.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned the advantages of building an app without many custom functions, made the code cleaner and easier to read.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
